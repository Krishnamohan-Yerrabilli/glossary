## What it is

When a programmer develops a game, software, or mathematical computation if an error occurs,
that program will likely not function as desired (undefined behavior). To identify the source
of the problem the developer has to review the code line-by-line. Without context, i.e. 
variables, data, location in memory, etc., catching errors is quite hard.

## Problem it addresses

Many times you create a game or a software or a mathematical computation, 
but when you run the code, you find out that the output is not really what
you expect now you will obviously not go ahead and delete the entire
program and re-code it, this will be an overwhelming task to the developers,
to addressing this kind of issues we perform debugging.

## How it helps

To pick out these error's, we have so many tools and strategies, by utilizing these tool's, 
developers will save a lot of time, for example, IDE's(it's just an application or software)
where the developer writes code in it, and another tool is a debug pointer, it is a simple but 
powerful tool, it can show us how the program behaves at a certain point in the code, 
debugging helps you not only get logical understanding but also analytical understanding 
of the problem, and debugging is one of the important skills a developer can have.
