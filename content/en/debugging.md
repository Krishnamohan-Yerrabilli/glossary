## What it is

To explain debugging, first we want to know what is a bug, it is an 
error or fault in a software program, which affects the program to 
print incorrect (or) unexpected output, To resolve these kinds of
unexpected behavior we do debug, in simple words debugging
is the process or activity of finding and removing these errors 
from a computer program or software, We do this to get the desired output.

## Problem it addresses

Many times you create a game or a software or a mathematical computation, 
but when you run the code, you find out that the output is not really what
you expect now you will obviously not go ahead and delete the entire
program and re-code it, this will be an overwhelming task to the developers,
to addressing this kind of issues we perform debugging.

## How it helps

To pick out these error's, we have so many tools and strategies, by utilizing these tool's, 
developers will save a lot of time, for example, IDE's(it's just an application or software)
where the developer writes code in it, and another tool is a debug pointer, it is a simple but 
powerful tool, it can show us how the program behaves at a certain point in the code, 
debugging helps you not only get logical understanding but also analytical understanding 
of the problem, and debugging is one of the important skills a developer can have.
